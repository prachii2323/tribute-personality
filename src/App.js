          <h2>About Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam</h2>
          <p>
          A.P.J. Abdul Kalam (born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong) Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in the development of India’s missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was president of India from 2002 to 2007.</p>

           <p>Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname “Missile Man.” Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.</p>

          <h2>Life and Legacy</h2>
          <p>
            Dr. Kalam played a crucial role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests
            in 1998, which established India as a nuclear power. He was also
            known for his advocacy for education and his inspirational speeches
            to the youth of India.
          </p>
          <p>
            After his presidential term, Dr. Kalam continued to inspire people
            through his books, speeches, and humanitarian work. He was awarded
            the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honor, in 1997.
          </p>
          <p>
          In 2002 India’s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) put forward Kalam to succeed outgoing President Kocheril Raman Narayanan. Kalam was nominated by the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) NDA even though he was Muslim, and his stature and popular appeal were such that even the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, also proposed his candidacy. Kalam easily won the election and was sworn in as India’s 11th president, a largely ceremonial post, in July 2002. He left office at the end of his term in 2007 and was succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the country’s first woman president

          </p>
